Topic: ${input.project.title}
Category: ${input.project.category}
Region: ${input.project.region}
Language: ${input.project.language}
Target user: ${targetUser(input.project.category)}
Goal: create a practical RouteMarket-ready research pack for this route.

## Research questions

- Which route segments are most important?
- Which places are must-see POI?
- What is the recommended season?
- What are the main safety or logistics warnings?
- Are there GPX/map references available legally?
- What facts require two or more independent sources?

## Required sources

- official/local source,
- at least two independent travel or outdoor sources,
- map source,
- forum/video source when useful,
- legal media or own/generated media later.

## Constraints

- Do not invent distance, elevation gain, surface, or difficulty.
- Mark uncertain facts clearly.
- Keep all sources in \`sources.json\`.
- Draft status only until human review.

## Current sources
